## Features
- Easy to use
- Supports **Arduino** and **Raspberry Pi**
- Custom colors
- Animations
- Scenes
- Music reactive effects / Visualizer
- Ambilight
- Neopixel simulator

## Hardware
- Windows/Linux/MacOS computer (not required when using Raspberry Pi)
- Arduino or Raspberry Pi
- WS2811, WS2812 or WS2812B LED strip

## Software
- [Java](https://java.com)
- [RemoteLight](https://github.com/Drumber/RemoteLightClient/releases/latest)
- [RemoteLightServer for Raspberry Pi](https://bitbucket.org/Drumber/remotelight/downloads/RemoteLightServer-pre0.2.0.1.jar)

## Quick Start
### Arduino
RemoteLight uses the Glediator protocol for Arduino. Download the [Glediator sketch](http://www.solderlab.de/index.php/downloads/file/33-ws2812-glediator-interface-v1), change the number of pixels and upload it to your Arduino.
> Note: Solderlab.de seems to be offline. You can alternatively download the sketch [here](https://workupload.com/file/vsSx8TBP) or use the [FastLED](https://github.com/marmilicious/FastLED_examples/blob/master/Glediator_test1.ino) variant.

Connect the Arduino to your computer and start RemoteLight. Click '*Add*' to add a new Arduino to the output list. Then select the correct COM port, enter the number of pixels and click '*Save*'.
Now you can activate the output by double clicking on it or by clicking on '*Activate*'.

### Raspberry Pi
First of all your Raspberry Pi must be prepared to control WS2811/WS2812 LEDs. There is a well described tutorial on tutorials-raspberrypi.com. [**> Tutorial <**](https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/connect-control-raspberry-pi-ws2812-rgb-led-strips/)  
After everything works out, you can move on.  
Now you just have to load the [RemoteLight-Server.jar](https://bitbucket.org/Drumber/remotelight/downloads/RemoteLightServer-pre0.2.0.1.jar) onto your Raspberry Pi and start it.
1. Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH.
2. Install Java: `sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-jdk`
3. Navigate to the directory where the RemoteLight-Server.jar is located, e.g.: `cd /home/pi/`
4. Start the server: `sudo java -jar RemoteLightServer-pre0.2.0.1.jar`
5. To stop the server: Type `end` or press `Ctrl + c`

Now start RemoteLight on your computer and click on '*Add*' > '*RLServer (Raspberry)*'. Enter the IP address of the Raspberry Pi in the '*Hostname / IP*' field (the Raspberry Pi must be on the same network).
Enter the number of pixels and click Save. If the server is running, you can click on '*Activate*'.
> Note: You can also use the Raspberry Pi without an additional computer. For this you need an OS with a graphical desktop installed on the Raspberry Pi. Start the server (as described above) + the RemoteLight control software and enter 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' in the 'Hostname / IP' field.

### Simulator
RemoteLight comes with a LED strip simulator in which you can test the effects without a WS2811/WS2812 strip. However, the effects look a thousand times better with a real LED strip üòâ.  
To use the simulator you need to go to the output menu and click on '*Open simulator*' in the upper right corner.  
A new window will open. Click on '*Enable*' to activate the simulator. Now go back to the output menu and add a new '*RLServer (Raspberry)*' output. Enter `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as hostname / IP and the number of pixels you want to simulate.

## TODO
- [ ] Create wiki / documentation
- [ ] Settings for animations
- [ ] Link / chain several LED strips
- [ ] Improve RemoteLightServer protocol
- [ ] Translate settings

Do you have any other suggestions‚ùî
